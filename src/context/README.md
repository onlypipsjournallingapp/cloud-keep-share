# Backend Connectivity

This application is currently set up with local state management for demonstration purposes. To implement full cross-device functionality with backend storage, you should:

1. Connect this application to a backend service like Supabase, Firebase, or a custom server
2. Implement authenticated API calls for each tab's functionality:
   - Note CRUD operations
   - Link storage and retrieval
   - File and media uploads with secure storage
   
3. Add user authentication to ensure data security and user-specific content

Once connected to a backend, all data will persist across sessions and be available on all devices.
